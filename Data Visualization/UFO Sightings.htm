<p> UFO is the acronym for "Unidentified Flying Object", which is a flying body that couldn't be recognised as a known thing by the observer. It is a phenomenon that is increasing more and more in the recent years, but it takes its origins in the first half of the XX century when there was the first documented sighting. 
UFOs are strongly connected with extra-terrestrial life; A long time ago in fact humans, feeling lonely in this huge universe, started to look for other forms of lives situated on planets so far away from the earth. Unfortunately this research did not lead to the expected result until now. No alien form has been found, but this myth influences a lot the common thought. Some people think that aliens will come to visit us using strange spaceships or that these extra-terrestrials are observing us to study our lives, planning an attack in the meanwhile. So there are lots of cases of people on earth reporting a sighting of strange objects that they weren't able to identify and recognise as a thing belonging to this planet; those are categorised as UFOs, and all the sightings are tracked to clarify this phenomenon.	</p>

            <p>Most of the reported encounters took place in USA. This happens because of the large importance the Americans give to this facts, thanks to the aura of mystery they are wrapped in. 
Using a dataset found on Kaggle we know that from 1910 to 2013 there were 64,434 UFO sightings in the US; they took place in different hours of the day and different months. The observed things had also different forms which are obtained thanks to the description given by the observer during the report. 
It is possible to explore all these encounters from this first visualisation, that resumes all the information given till now:

            <p>It emerges that most of the encounters took place during evening/night hours as it's easy to imagine for the lack of light in that part of the day. Another feature is the month: the summer brings the most UFO sightings during the year, with a prevalence in July. In general the map shows that people in the east part of USA or on the coasts are more likely to see UFOs than the others. Finally, there's no correlation between UFO shapes and states; but it's easy to see that the most observed form is the "Light" one.
			</p>

<h5>  <img src="css/tech.png"> </h5>

<p>The number of sightings is almost constant for most of the century, till 1993 . In the first part of XX century were registered some sightings in different places of the US but they were not a significative number. This could be explained for the inefficiency of  past years' reporting. The real explosion of the phenomenon takes place in the 90's; in fact, thanks to the invention of Internet and the consequent really fast diffusion in the world, people are able to share their experiences with others, increasing the common fantasies and making the mystery grow exponentially.
Together with the Internet revolution there's also a strong increase in the use of cellular phones. It makes easier than before to catch the moment of the encounter, maybe with a photo or a video, and then share it on the online communities.
From now on, all the people are able to see the evidences of UFO existence on their own; mass-media begin to talk about the phenomenon too, with tv programs and dedicated magazines.
Also the production of sci-fi movies increased, in US above all, making people's fantasies become more an more different and complicated. In fact more UFO shapes started to be seen more than before and the number of encounters itself didn't stop to grow up.

<p>This second visualization shows some peaks that could be explained by some external events. In 1947 there was the Roswell's accident: a United States Army Air Forces balloon crashed at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Following wide initial interest in the crashed "flying disc", the US military stated that it was merely a conventional weather balloon. Interest subsequently, when ufologists began promoting a variety of increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories, claiming that one or more alien spacecraft had crash-landed, and that the extraterrestrial occupants had been recovered by the military, who then engaged in a cover-up.
Later, in 1965 there was the Kecksburg's incident: a large, brilliant fireball was seen by thousands in at least six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan - Windsor, Canada area, reportedly dropped hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, starting some grass fires, and caused sonic booms in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.
Finally, in 2012, according to Maya's calendar, there would have been the end of the World so there was the highest peak ever in UFOs encounters, maybe for a common fear of an alien's invasion.
 </p>
            <h5>  <img src="css/conclusion.png"> </h5>
            <p>The increasing trend in the years between 1994 and 2013 is evident; the same happens for the correlation between the UFO sightings and the development of Internet. 
From the research is clear that, according to the documented encounters, the probability of the existence of other life forms is very high and the number of people trying to solve the mystery and give a real and irrefutable video or photo evidence is growing. Internet invention and cellular phones' diffusion of course helped a lot the strong development of the phenomenon, and a new market (media, movies) was born around it.
Eventually UFOs and aliens in general have now influenced forever the common thought but they are nowadays a mystery that still needs to be solved.		</p>

 <h5>Methodological notes for the first infoviz</h5>
              <p>To perform our analysis we used a dataset provided by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORG) that recently released its data: the American organization, in fact, investigates on aliens since 1974 and has collected and cataloged almost 90,000 reports on alleged UFO sightings and meetings with aliens all over the world. This dataset is made available through the Kaggle platform. Initially we had 10 variables available in the following table.
<h5><img border="0" src="css/variables.png" style="margin: 0 auto;"> </h5>
<p> First we wanted to create an explorative infographic in terms of time and space. We visualized the space through latitude and longitude on a map of the United States of America; the size is proportional to the number of UFO sightings in these specific geographical coordinates; tooltips show details about description of the event and the place. The date has been divided into three variables: time, month and year. For the hours a radial bar chart is used, built by constructing parameters and translating the variables into polar coordinates: sine and cosine. Night and day are rapresented by a color scale red/blue. The months are viewed through a bar chart, while the years are filterable in multiple dropdown labels.In the same infographic the UFO shape is reported through a treemap, so the area is proportional to the percentage of the total, in addition for each selected shape appears an icon that identifies it. Depending on the selected filters, the total number of sightings is reported.
We wanted to build an interactive infoviz in the way you can filter the data exploring the trend in different time slots, depending on the season and over the years; You can select different UFO shapes; You can explore the map by noting unusual distributions in certain places and the counters also show the numerical details.

              <h5>HDI - Euristics followed</h5>
              <p>For ours dataviz we decided to focus and follow this three euristics:<br>
<ol>
<li> <p>Overview: it's possible to see the overviews of the entire collection both in the first and in the second visualization. In the first one the data are located in the US geographical map while in the second one there are two timeline which represent the trend of  the UFO sightings and  the expansion of internet and the mobile phones.</li>
				<li> <p>Filter:
Using the filter on the right of the first visualization the user can choose through different hours, months and years in order to visualize only the encounters that he desires on the US map. In the same visualization the user can also filter the data with the shape table on the left.</li>
				<li> <p> Details-on-demand: In the first visualization with the hover function of the mouse is possible to view details about the aliens sightings. For example, if the user goes above an object in the shape table, a tooltip with all the information about that object will be displayed, such as the shape icon and the percentage of the total of UFO sightings. In the second visualization the user is able to see information about the UFO sightings trend by clicking on the timeline and here is possible to analyze the correlation between the growth of this phenomenon with the release of the most important film of that period.</li>

              <h5>Quality assessments</h5>
              <p> We have analized the first infographic through two qualitative and psychometric evaluations and a user test.
<p>( <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/sDSdoQd5SkRJ4s272"> Phychometric survey in italian</a>;
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/sDSdoQd5SkRJ4s272"> User test in italian</a>) </p>
<p>The first survey in fact contained an open question that allowed us to refer to the difficulties encountered. Some users have encountered problems with the first filter of the years. So we decided to listen to our users and change filter type in order to make it easier.
<p><img border="0" src="css/year1.png" style="margin: 0 auto;"></p> 
<p>In the beginning, in fact, we used the range of dates.
This type of filter has an excellent feature: you can easily select time intervals. The problem was that the bar inside the infographic was restricted and the selection of precise time intervals was difficult. Furthermore, by pressing twice on the date, a calendar appears and you can easily search for the desired day for the beginning and for the end of the interval: the problem was that it became not intuitive and the result was not functional. For that reason we changed our intentions and we have used a multiple dropdown labels filter in which it is possible select one or more years; we have changed and analized the dataviz in a new version with a second phychometric survey.

<hr>
              <h5>Psychometric survey</h5>
              <p>In order to evaluate our first visualization, we created a psychometric survey in Italian that allowed us to obtain judgments on some qualitative aspects. We submitted these requests to a group of 36 people asking them to evaluate the infoviz through a scale from 1 (Very little) to 6 (Very much) relative to some qualitative attributes such as: "Interesting" (Interessante), "Confusionary" (Confusionaria), "Intuitive" (Intuitiva), "Difficult" (Difficile), "Beautiful" (Bella) and "Common" (Comune). The idea was to have the same number of positive and negative adjectives so that this could not affect the user's judgment. The ideal expectation is to obtain high scores for positive and low scores for negative adjectives.
The qualitative attributes were then binarized. Being the scale from 1 to 6, we divided the values: from 1 to 3 were labeled as "in disagreement", while those from 4 to 6 as "in agreement". Thus, through a bar chart, we have represented the percentage of responses in disagreement through the blue color, and in accordance with the yellow for each group of adjectives (positive and negative). The confidence intervals for each qualitative attribute indicated on the y axis are also shown.		
<p><img border="0" src="css/psyco.png" style="margin: 0 auto;"></p> 
			  <p>It can be seen that positive adjectives have a higher percentage of responses in agreement: 95% confidence intervals do not reach 20% of disagreeing answers for all three cases.
Negative attributes show a majority of disagreed answers. In particular for example, only 11% of respondents are in agreement with the adjective "Confusionary", with a 95% confidence interval that does not reach 17% as the upper limit.
This means that all attributes have a statistically significant ideal response.

The case of the adjective "Common" is controversial: in fact, this term is confusing. While in the construction of the survey we thought of the adjective "common" as negative, in the sense of ordinary, not innovative, not surprising; some have associated the term with something positive by associating it with something familiar, well known and therefore recognizable and easily interpretable. Probably it was this misunderstanding to get a distribution of responses with greater variance and with a concentration in the median answers.
Here there is its distribution in comparison with the distribution of the responses for the adjective "Beautiful".
<p><img border="0" src="css/distribution.png" style="margin: 0 auto;"></p> 

<p>For a better analysis we decided to test answers with a comparison to different groups. We asked users of the sample to give us some other features so that they could be divided into two groups and studied any significant differences.
We divided the sample into two groups based on a known feature: if the user was a student of TTC or Data Science at University of Milan - Bicocca or not. This characteristic in fact presupposes that the student is expert of the subject and already knows what this analysis is aimed at evaluating; furthermore, technological skills in Tableau are assumed and therefore it knows how certain filters and interactions work in the infographic. For that reason we named the groups "Expert" and "Not Expert" and we divided the answers.
Here the distribution of the responces for qualitative attribute for groups: y-axis shows how much users gave that answer; x-axis shows the answers from 1 to 6; different attributes are represented in different horizontal plot; groups changes based on colours (yellow for "Not Expert", blue for "Expert").

<p><img border="0" src="css/comp.png" style="margin: 0 auto;"></p> 

<p> Differences between groups are not significant with a confidence at 95% expect for the case of the attribute "Commun" that performs a t-test with a p-value = 0.023 (< 0.05). So we reject the null hypothesis that the two groups evaluate the adjective in the same way: the "Expert" group has mean = 2.39, the "Not Expert" group instead has a greater mean = 3.28. </p>

			  <hr>
<p>To evaluate the correlation between the qualitative attributes present in the survey, we considered it appropriate to use a correlogram. This is a matrix in which the correlations between attributes are represented based on responses.
<p><img border="0" src="css/corplot.png" style="margin: 0 auto;"></p> 
			  <p>In the upper triangle there are corrplots, which differ in lines and color. These indicate the strength of the correlation, which varies from -1 to 1.
The more the lines are similar to a vertical line, the greater the correlation is, which depending on the upward or downward inclination can be respectively positive or negative.
The more the lines are similar to an horizontal line, the more this attribute approaches 0.
Blue corresponds to positive values while red to negative values.
The correlation values are represented in the lower triangle.
A red point is showed if the statistic is not significant at 95% confidence.
We note that adjectives classified as positive have a negative correlation with positive ones: this is easily understood and reflects our expectations.
In reality, the calculated p-values are greater than 0.05 for each correlation between attribute pair.
Each p-value tests the null hypothesis h0 = no correlation between the two attributes. We can therefore consider only significant correlations with p-value <0.05, so those that allow us to reject this null hypothesis, which however in our case are not present (all pairs has the red point).
None of our correlations is significant.


<hr>
              <h5>User Test</h5>
              <p>
To get feedback on the efficiency of the first visualization we asked 22 people to do a task, recording the correctness of the answers and the time taken. 
We divided people into two groups: "Expert" and "Not Expert"; this selection is based to the same feature of the first survey ($Phychometric survey)
To evaluate the difference in response times, we considered it appropriate to use the Violin Plot, as it is the most effective method.
We calculated the time taken by each subject to respond to five tasks in the user test; the time in seconds has been represented on the axis of the ordinates.
If a user gave the wrong answer at least to one of the tasks is represented on the violin plot by a red point, while if he was right is represented by a black point.
In the plot it is represented the boxplot for each group too.

<p><img border="0" src="css/violin.png" style="margin: 0 auto;"></p>

<p>It is possible to notice that, on average, the response times of the "Not expert" are greater than the "Expert". In fact, the average execution time of the tasks for "Not Expert" is 441 seconds, against the 345 seconds of the "Expert". The difference between the two averages is therefore 95 seconds and by performing a t-test on this quantity (time "Not expert" - time "Expert"), it results that there is a significant difference between the execution times of the tasks, t(10) = 2.79, p-value = 0.019, for which the University student group takes significantly less time than the inexperienced group.
Furthermore, we note that the "Expert" group in answering tasks has a lower percentage of errors: 10% against 20% of incorrect answers in the "Not expert" group. Using the Fisher test on the contingency table containing right and wrong answers for the two groups, we obtain a p-value of 0.89. That's mean that there is no significant difference between the two groups regarding the correctness of the execution of the requested tasks.</p>
